## 🚀 About Me  
I’m a **Data Engineer** with expertise in scalable, secure, and AI-ready data platforms — experienced in designing, building, and maintaining modern **data lakehouse architectures** on Azure and AWS.  
I focus on transforming raw data into structured, governed, and value-driven assets that empower analytical and business decisions.  

Currently at **Deloitte**, I work on a large-scale data documentation and mapping project, involving:  
- SQL code analysis and reverse engineering,  
- variable mapping and transformation lineage,  
- metadata standardization and data governance enforcement (LGPD compliance).  

I’m in the final semester of my **MBA in Data Engineering**, focused on:  
- **Azure & AWS** cloud architecture,  
- **DataOps and DevOps** for analytics pipelines,  
- **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and LLMs**,  
- **Data Visualization** (Power BI, Tableau) and **Advanced Analytics**.
